## Bank Transaction Management 

This program simulates a simple transaction management system for a  bank using Java. The program prompts the user to enter their account number, name, and account balance. It then displays a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, view transaction history, and view account summary.

The program keeps track of all transactions and displays them in a transaction history table. Each transaction includes a timestamp, account balance before and after the transaction, transaction type (deposit or withdrawal), transaction amount, and transaction status (successful or declined).

### Usage

To run the program, execute the lab4.java file using the Java compiler. The program will prompt you to enter your account number, name, and balance. Once you have entered this information, you can use the menu options to perform transactions and view your account information.
