## Question

Create a new folder in git named 'Lab 7' for the following question and solve the following: create a flowchart and document the results, constraints, etc., in the README.md file for the lab.

Given the famous iris dataset, find the 5-point summary [Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max] for the attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.

Once the overall summary statistics have been calculated, identify the summary statistics for each Species of iris flower [Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica].

Present your results in the appropriate format and write the results in a file.

## Iris Data Analysis Program

Given the famous iris dataset, find the 5-point summary [Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max] for the attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.

Once the overall summary statistics have been calculated, identify the summary statistics for each Species of iris flower [Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica].

This is a Java program that analyzes the famous Iris flower dataset. The program reads a CSV file containing the data and performs some basic statistical analysis on it. The analysis includes calculating the mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation of each feature for each of the three species of Iris flowers in the dataset.
## USAGE
You will also need to have a CSV file containing the Iris dataset. The program expects the CSV file to have the following columns: "Id", "SepalLengthCm", "SepalWidthCm", "PetalLengthCm", "PetalWidthCm", and "Species".

## Running the Program
To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the Java source code.

## OUTPUT:
The program will output the results of the analysis to the console and also write a summary table to a text file named "Output.txt" in the same directory as the CSV file.
